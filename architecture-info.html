            safe and economical. You'll usually control a project from start to

<h1>Work experience</h1>  
   <p>Itâ€™s important to hone your drawing skills as much as possible, so practise drawing whenever you can. 
       Model-making skills are also an advantage. Take an interest in publications or 
       TV programmes about buildings, and to keep up to date with the current trends in architecture and design.
    </p> 
       <p>Any pre-entry work experience in an architectural, design or construction environment is desirable and highly regarded by recruiters.
            Many firms offer internship opportunities over the summer break, which can provide invaluable experience
        </p>    
            <p>Try to develop contacts in the industry, through work experience, academic departments, personal contacts and 
                local representatives of professional bodies and associations. Joining one of the professional bodies,
                 which usually offer free student membership, provides access to professional journals and information about vacancies.
